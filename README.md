# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of version control with Git, refined my skills in setting up a development environment, and applied the core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to create a functional web application.
